Extract Handwriting from Background
My goal is to remove the Yellow background and keep only the handwriting  in front


I used pycharm , to run the program first you have to install this packages below in terminal
1.pip install numpy
2. pip install opencv-python

Warning : you may have Warning "Cannot find reference 'imread' in '__init__.py | __init__.py'" , its just bug in
pycharm , the Program will run normally

use this command to run the Program, i have to include the Input and the Outputs folders for segmentation each image
from Input folder and the result well be seen in Output folder , and the code is in background_remove.py
python3 background_remove.py Input\ images/ Outputs/
